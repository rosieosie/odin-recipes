    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Served piping hot with a hunk of crusty bread, this creamy, nourishing butternut squash soup recipe is fall comfort food at its best.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="list">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li class="list">1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li class="list">½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li class="list">1 (3-pound) butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
        <li class="list">3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li class="list">1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage</li>
        <li class="list">½ tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li class="list">1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li class="list">3 to 4 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li class="list">Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="list">Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, salt, and several grinds of fresh pepper and sauté until soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the squash and cook until it begins to soften, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li class="list">Add the garlic, sage, rosemary, and ginger. Stir and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant, then add 3 cups of the broth. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until the squash is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li class="list">Let cool slightly and pour the soup into a blender, working in batches if necessary, and blend until smooth. If your soup is too thick, add up to 1 cup more broth and blend. Season to taste and serve with parsley, pepitas, and crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
