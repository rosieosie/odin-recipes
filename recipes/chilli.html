    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Adding white beans makes this heartier than your average chicken noodle soup, and the addition of green chiles, jalapeño, and sour cream add the perfect amount of heat and creaminess to switch up classic chili. Plus, everything comes together in less than an hour, making it an easy, no-stress dinner to cozy up to any time of year.</p>

        <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground cumin</li>
        <li>3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into thirds</li>
        <li>5 c. low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 (4.5-oz.) cans green chiles</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 (15-oz.) cans white beans, drained, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 c. frozen corn</li>
        <li>1/2 c. sour cream</li>
        <li>1 avocado, thinly sliced, for serving</li>
        <li>1/4 c. chopped fresh cilantro, for serving</li>
        <li>1/4 c. crushed tortilla chips, for serving</li>
        <li>1/4 c. shredded Monterey Jack, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and jalapeño and cook, stirring, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken, broth, and chiles; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until chicken is tender and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and shred with 2 forks. 
        </li>
        <li>Add beans to pot and bring to a simmer. Cook, smashing about one-quarter of beans with a wooden spoon, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Add corn and shredded chicken and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream.
        </li>
        <li>Ladle chili into bowls. Top with avocado, cilantro, chips, and cheese.
